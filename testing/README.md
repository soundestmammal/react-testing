This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Move forward with Higher Order Components

It is a normal react component that is used to have code reuse.

When we create HOC, we combine them with normal components.

When we combine them then it will become a composed component

Lecture 66:

Connect - Higher order component (HOC)

We could have written out a bunch of code that would have reached up to the redux store
but instead we used an open source library to make things easier for us.

Lecture 67:

What application will we build to learn to build with HOC

At local host 3000, we will show them the orginal application,

Where do things get interesting? Things will get more interesting

When the user tried to get to the /post route...

Is the user logged in?

if(loggedin) => {Allow user access}

else: Redirect the user back to the home page.

Rquire Auth is going to be a higher order component. We use HOC to reuse code, but if we wanted to we can think of a situation where a user can use to restrict access to control the flow of the application. While we won't exactly use it right now, we can have many situations that we can imagine that we would have a feature that we would want to use this for.
